# flaskuse
This is my first project using Flask and APIs. At the beginning, I was really confused with all the new terms like Flask, Postman, API, and REST, and honestly, I even thought about giving up. But I used Google Gemini as a guide, and it helped me break things down into simple, understandable code.

While working on it, I also learned what the different HTTP methods do:
	•	PUT is for modifying data.
	•	GET is for reading data.
	•	POST is for adding new data.
	•	DELETE is for removing data.

How I ran the project:
First, I ran the code in VS Code. Then I opened the Postman application, copied my URL, and went to Body → Raw → JSON. From there, I could start performing CRUD operations and test how everything worked.
